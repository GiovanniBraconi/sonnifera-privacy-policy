# Privacy Policy for Sonnifera

**Effective Date:** September 30, 2025

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Sonnifera ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Sonnifera (the "App").

This policy has been prepared in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Data Controller
The data controller, responsible for your information under GDPR, is the developer of the Sonnifera app.

For any privacy-related questions or requests, please contact us at:
**sonnifera.app@gmail.com**

## 3. Information We Collect
Our App is designed with a "privacy-first" approach, meaning we collect the absolute minimum information necessary for the App to function.

### A. Information You Provide to Us
* **Sleep Schedule Data:** We collect the preferred bedtime and wake-up time that you voluntarily set within the App. This information is the core component required to provide you with our service.

### B. Information Processed Locally on Your Device
* **Device Screen Status:** To provide "smart" reminders, the App checks whether your device's screen is currently on or off. **This check is performed entirely on your device and this status information is never transmitted, stored, or shared with us or any third party.**

### C. Information Collected by Third-Party Services
We may use third-party services for essential functions like crash reporting and analytics to improve the App's stability and user experience. These services may collect standard, non-personally identifiable technical data.

* **Google Play Services:** The App uses services provided by Google for delivering notifications.
* **Analytics and Crash Reporting (e.g., Google Firebase):** To identify and fix bugs, we may use services that automatically collect information about your device, such as the device model, operating system version, and anonymized crash logs. This data does not personally identify you.

## 4. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect solely for the following purposes:

* **To Provide and Maintain the App's Core Functionality:** Your Sleep Schedule Data is used exclusively to trigger bedtime and wake-up reminders at the times you have specified.
* **To Enhance User Experience:** By checking the Device Screen Status, we ensure reminders are only sent at appropriate times, preventing unnecessary disturbances.
* **To Improve Our App:** Anonymized crash reports and analytics data help us understand how our App is performing, identify bugs, and make improvements.

## 5. Data Storage and Security
Your **Sleep Schedule Data** is stored **locally on your device only**. It is not transmitted to, or stored on, any external servers owned by us or any third party. The security of this data is dependent on the security of your own device.

Deleting the App from your device will permanently delete all locally stored Sleep Schedule Data.

## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal Sleep Schedule Data with third parties for marketing or any other purpose.

## 7. Your Rights Under GDPR
As a user in the European Union, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

* **The right to access, update, or delete** the information we have on you. (You can do this directly within the App by changing or clearing your schedule, or by uninstalling the App).
* **The right of rectification.** You have the right to have your information corrected if it is inaccurate.
* **The right to be forgotten.** You have the right to request the erasure of your personal data.
* **The right to restrict processing.** You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the email provided above.

## 8. Children's Privacy
Our App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 14 (the age of digital consent in Italy). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 14. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within this same public repository. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
